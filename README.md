# Crypto Application
I am not part of the Turkcell GeleceÄŸi Yazanlar Bootcamp, but I had the opportunity to access the assignments. To reinforce my knowledge and speed up my progress, I decided to complete all the assignments and then start uploading apps to the store. Now, I present to you the second assignment, a crypto application that works only locally.
